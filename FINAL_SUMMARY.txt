- 4 comprehensive documentation guides

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Get Feedback)
```
✅ Academy page ready to deploy
✅ Labs work perfectly (tested generators)
✅ Security config in place (default safe)
→ Share with beta users
→ Gather feedback
→ Iterate based on real usage
```

### Option 2: Harden First (Security First)
```
⏳ Complete API validation (2 hours)
⏳ Gate pip installs (30 min)
⏳ Add schema validation (1 hour)
⏳ Test everything
→ Deploy hardened version
→ Then gather feedback
```

### Recommended: Do Both in Parallel
```
✅ Deploy current state to beta users
🔄 Complete security hardening (1-2 weeks)
📊 Gather feedback while hardening
🎯 Iterate v1.1 based on real usage + security
```
